# Churn_Prediction
**Steps to Integrate SQL Server with Power BI for Churn Prediction Visualization:**

Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

Download and install SSMS to manage and query SQL Server databases.

Install SQL Server:

Download and install SQL Server to enable database operations.

Check if SQL Server is Running:

Open Command Prompt and run the command sqlcmd -L to list available SQL Servers.

Alternatively, use sqlcmd -S DESKTOP-TC3ALB7\SQLEXPRESS -E to connect to a specific instance.

Connect to SQL Server via SSMS:

Open SSMS and connect to the SQL Server instance using appropriate credentials.

Write and Execute SQL Queries:

In SSMS, open a new query window and write your SQL queries to interact with the database.

Load Data into Power BI:

Connect Power BI to SQL Server, and load the data directly from the database into Power BI.

Transform Data in Power BI:

Use Power BI’s Power Query Editor to transform the data as per your requirements.

In the Model view, create relationships between newly created tables and reference the original tables.

Create Churn Prediction Visualizations:

Using Power BI, visualize the churn prediction results through various charts and tables.

Train the Random Forest Model:

Train a Random Forest model to predict customer churn using the data in Power BI or other external tools.

Store Predicted Data:

Save the churn prediction results in a new file and note the file’s location for later use.

Load Views Data into Power BI:

Load the two files containing views data into Power BI for further analysis.

Check and Verify the Predicted Data:

Verify the saved predicted churn data in the specified file location.

Use Predicted Data for Final Visualization:

Use the churn prediction data to create meaningful visualizations in Power BI, reflecting the model’s predictions.
